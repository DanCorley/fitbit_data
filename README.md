# Analzying User Fitbit Data

If you're an owner of a Fitbit watch, you'll be happy to know that you're able to export an archive of your user data, including number of steps taken, average heart rate, and sleep scores since the beginning of owning and wearing your watch. This is available for all users from here - [Fitbit User Data Download](https://www.fitbit.com/settings/data/export)

This project aims to simplify the analysis creating a template for user data.
